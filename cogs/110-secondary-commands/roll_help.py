However, you may also specify the amount of dice being rolled, like `3d100`. This also works without the amount [so `d100` is the same as `100`].
You can also roll multiple different sets of dice in the same command (like `2d10 3d20`). This is effectively the same as doing two seperate commands for each..

Ranges are also supported, however this does not work without the `d` prefix [which also applies to the rest of this entire document].
You can do something like `d10:100`. Both extremes are also included, so you could roll a 10 or 100.

You can also use underscores, which will get completely removed before parsing (e.g. `1d10_000_000` = `1d10000000`). This is especially useful for large numbers."""))

The most basic type is math operations, like +, -, \\*, ^, and /. You can tack them to the end of a roll (like `d100+5*3`) and they will modify the result of the roll (in left-to-right order, no PEMDAS)

There are two other types of modifiers, on the next two pages."""))

- `3d100i1,3:+20` will roll 3 dice and then add 20 to the first and third.
- `3d100i1,3:+20;2,-5` will do the same, and then subtract 5 from the second.
To put it into actual words, though, the part before the colon is what rolls are selected, and the part after is the list of modifiers. You can do multiple, e.g. *+20\\*3*."""))

- *l* will format the roll into a list.
- *l5* will do the same but split it into groups of 5.
- *s* will only display the sum.
- *==50* will highlight rolls which are exactly 50.
- *>50* will highlight rolls that are at least 50.
- *<50* will highlight rolls that are 50 or lower.
- You can do the last two without a number, in which it will default to the maximum and minimum respectively.
- *top2* will highlight the top 2 rolls.
- *bottom2* will highlight the bottom 2 rolls.
- The two above work the same as > and < respectively, if they don't have a number."""))
